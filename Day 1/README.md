 Day 1 Summary – Design Thinking & Use Case Framing

    Design Thinking Introduction:
    Understood the 5 stages – Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, Test.

    Use Case Framing:
    Selected problem: Safe navigation for factory AGVs using sensors and ML.

    Case Study Activity:
    Analyzed a machine failure prediction scenario to understand sensor-based data use in predictive maintenance.

    Problem Identification:
    Defined core challenges: real-time obstacle detection, human presence, and low-latency path correction.

    Outcome:
    Framed a real-world industrial automation problem integrating Embedded Systems + Cloud + ML.
