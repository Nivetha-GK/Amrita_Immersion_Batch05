## ðŸ§° Technologies Used

- Raspberry Pi Pico W (MicroPython)
- Ultrasonic, IR, and PIR sensors
- Wokwi Simulator (for virtual prototyping)
- ThingSpeak IoT Cloud Platform
- Python & HTTP for API communication

## ðŸš€ Workflow

1. Sensors detect environment (distance, motion, line/surface).
2. Raspberry Pi Pico W collects and formats data.
3. Data is sent to **ThingSpeak**.
4. Live plots and logs are displayed on the ThingSpeak dashboard.
5. CSV datasets can be exported for ML applications.
