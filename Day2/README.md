## ðŸ“… Day 2 Summary â€“ Simulation & Sensor Data Streaming

- Simulated the AGV navigation system using *Wokwi online simulator*.
- Integrated *Ultrasonic, IR, and PIR sensors* with Raspberry Pi Pico W in the virtual environment.
- Programmed the Pico W to read real-time sensor data.
- Established Wi-Fi connectivity and pushed live data to *ThingSpeak cloud platform*.
- Verified successful data transmission and visualization on the cloud dashboard.
- Ensured 15-second delay for compliance with ThingSpeak rate limits.

âœ… Output: Functional simulation of sensor-based obstacle detection and live cloud data logging.
