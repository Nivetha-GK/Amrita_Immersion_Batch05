### Autonomous Navigation Sytsem for Factory Floor Robots (AGVs)

Sensors : Ultrasonic , IR , PIR

## Problem Description:
AGVs in fatories must navigate safely around humans and obstacles. Ultrasonic, IR, PIR sensors detect proximity and motion. Sensor data is uploaded to the cloud where ML models drive navigation decisions. Data analytics identifies movement bottlenecks, high traffic zones and route efficiency. Visual tools support AGV traffic optimization and reduce collision risks, improving overall productivity and safety.
