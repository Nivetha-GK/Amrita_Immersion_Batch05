The Smart AGV (Automated Guided Vehicle) Navigation System is an ongoing project aimed at improving autonomous navigation within dynamic factory environments. The system is designed to enhance safety, efficiency, and decision-making for AGVs operating in shared spaces with humans, forklifts, and other moving elements.

The core idea revolves around integrating multiple onboard sensors—Ultrasonic, Infrared (IR), and PIR—to detect obstacles in real time. These detections enable the AGV to make quick local decisions and reroute itself without relying entirely on cloud commands. Simultaneously, critical data such as AGV location, obstacle events, and route history is transmitted to a cloud-based machine learning platform.

This cloud system will analyze historical traffic patterns to identify high-congestion zones, enable predictive maintenance, and optimize route planning. An administrative dashboard will provide real-time visibility into AGV performance, heatmaps, and alerts, supporting data-driven operational decisions.

The project is currently in the development phase, with key components such as sensor integration, route mapping, and dashboard planning in progress. Once complete, this system is expected to significantly reduce collision risks, improve workflow efficiency, and offer a scalable solution for smart factory automation.
